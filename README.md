# <Social-Network-API>

## Description

- My motivation was to make an app that was similar to a socail media application.
- I built this to increase my knowledge on using mongoose and MongoDB by having several different DB inputs attatched to one another.
- This app solves the problem of needing a place where one can have thoughts and users can react to them through digital firendships.
- I learned how to use moggose much more effeiciently in this project.
